# gym_app

app for making an exercise list at the gym
- tested in iOS and web, not sure about android and MacOS
- need to run the firestore emulator to use the app currently


## Exercise list shows a list of exercises
- You can delete exercises by pressing the trash can

## Create Exercise lets you add another exercise 
- These are currently setup to save & get from firestore

## Bottom nav uses go_router

## Testing is mostly just for rendering, still wrapping my head around testing (especially testing firebase)

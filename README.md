# gym_app

An app for making an exercise list at the gym
- tested in iOS and web, unsure about android and MacOS
- need to run the firestore emulator to use the app currently

## Exercise list shows a list of exercises
- You can delete exercises by pressing the trash can next to them

## Create Exercise Screen lets you add another exercise 
- These are currently setup to save & get from firestore

## Bottom nav utilizing go_router 

## Using Riverpod for databaseProvider and responsive updates to exercise list

## Testing is mostly just for rendering, still wrapping my head around testing (especially testing firebase)
